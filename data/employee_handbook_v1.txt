NebulaGears — Employee Handbook (v1)
Document: employee_handbook_v1.txt
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2024-01-15
Author: People & Culture

Overview:
NebulaGears believes in empowering employees with trust, flexibility, and independence. We aim to create a high-performance culture where outcomes are valued over seat time. As part of this vision, we have adopted an open remote-work stance for the company.

Work From Anywhere Program — Summary:
"At NebulaGears, we believe in complete freedom. All employees are eligible for the 'Work From Anywhere' program. You can work remotely 100% of the time from any location. No prior approval is needed."

Purpose:
- To enable high-performing employees to work in environments where they are most productive.
- To attract diverse talent across geographies.
- To reduce commuting burden and promote work-life balance.

Eligibility:
- All full-time and part-time NebulaGears employees are eligible for the Work From Anywhere program from day one of employment.
- Contractors and consultants assigned to NebulaGears are eligible on a case-by-case basis; please coordinate with your vendor manager.
- Locations must remain in compliance with local labor and tax regulations; persons planning to work from a different country should notify People & Culture for payroll/tax guidance (notification is not an approval gate for remote work unless otherwise required by local law).

Key Principles:
- Trust & Autonomy: We trust employees to manage their time and deliverables. Managers focus on outcomes, not hours.
- Communication: Team-level alignment is required; employees are responsible for communicating their schedules to teammates and attending agreed-upon collaboration times.
- Security & Compliance: Company security policies (device encryption, use of VPN for protected resources, MFA, etc.) remain in effect regardless of location.

Expectations & Best Practices:
- Availability: While employees can plan their remote days freely, they must attend mandatory team meetings and be responsive during designated core hours. Each team should establish core collaboration hours for overlap.
- Equipment: NebulaGears provides a basic equipment stipend for eligible roles. Employees are responsible for reliable internet connectivity and a professional workspace.
- Timezones: Employees should work with their manager to set regular check-ins; when working across timezones, teams should agree on overlapping hours for collaboration.
- Performance: Productivity expectations remain unchanged; employees must meet deliverables and performance metrics laid out by their manager.

Manager and Team Responsibilities:
- Managers should set clear expectations, goals, and success metrics tailored to remote-friendly workflows.
- Teams are encouraged to schedule regular check-ins, async updates, and preserve synchronous time for collaboration.
- Managers should monitor employee engagement and work to create an inclusive environment that supports remote employees.

Security Policies:
- Devices with access to NebulaGears systems must have company-approved endpoint protection and OS updates enabled.
- Confidential information must be handled with the same care and encryption standards as in-office work.
- Any breach, loss of device, or suspicious security incident must be reported immediately to Security and the employee's manager.

Travel and In-office Requirements:
- There are no routine mandatory office-day requirements under this version of the handbook.
- Teams may request or schedule in-office sessions for activities such as onboarding, all-hands, and team offsites; these are not mandatory unless explicitly stated for a given event.

Special Circumstances & Exceptions:
- Business-critical days: Some business needs (product launch days, critical client engagements, or scheduled on-site training) may require presence in the office. The company will aim to give advance notice.
- Insurance, visas, and tax considerations may require HR or People & Culture to coordinate with employees working outside their home country.

Onboarding & Mentorship:
- Onboarding program content and mentorship opportunities are available both virtually and in-person.
- Teams are encouraged to design hybrid onboarding options, but the company remains flexible in how mentorship is delivered.

Glossary & Definitions:
- "Remote Work": Any work done away from a NebulaGears office location.
- "Work From Anywhere": Program allowing employees to work from any geographical location subject to local law compliance and tax considerations.

Contact and Questions:
- For any questions about Work From Anywhere policy, device stipends, payroll, or taxes, contact People & Culture at people@nebulagears.example.

Note on Revisions:
- This is an early iteration of the handbook and subject to revisions. Future updates may introduce role-specific exceptions, manager approvals, or capped remote days as we grow and learn more about operational needs.

Detailed Policies & Procedures:

1) Work From Anywhere — Long-Form Details:
- Remote Work Options: Employees can work fully remote, hybrid, or from office; the program is intentionally flexible to support multiple workstyles.
- Notification Expectations: While prior approval isn't required, employees should notify their manager of any transitions to a different timezone, and provide a short note in team calendars when taking extended remote trips (> 2 weeks) for team planning.
- Cross-border Remote Work: Working from a different country for longer than 90 days requires coordination with People & Culture for payroll and tax reasons. It is the employee's responsibility to confirm eligibility with People & Culture before making longer-term cross-border plans.

2) Remote Work Performance Management:
- Goals & KPIs: Managers are expected to set measurable goals and check-ins with the employee at onboarding and during performance reviews.
- One-on-ones: Weekly or bi-weekly one-on-ones are recommended for remote employees to ensure alignment and engagement.

3) Intern-specific Onboarding Considerations (General guidance only):
- Onboarding Schedule: Interns should receive a detailed 90-day onboarding plan with expected milestones, learning goals, and regular mentor check-ins.
- Training & Shadowing: Interns are encouraged to schedule overlapping hours with senior engineers and be part of pairing sessions; the company provides a mentorship guideline for managers.

4) Equipment, Stipend & Workspace:
- Stipend Eligibility: Full time employees receive a one-time equipment stipend (amount varies by role) and a monthly remote-work allowance for internet of up to $75/month where applicable.
- Equipment Procurement: To request company devices, fill out the Device Request Form in the People & Culture portal. Equipment remains company property.
- Ergonomics & Health: NebulaGears encourages employees to maintain an ergonomic workspace. We provide a stipend for ergonomic accessories on request (provided via the Device Request Form).

5) Security & Data Privacy (Expanded):
- Access Controls: Remote employees must access NebulaGears resources using the approved VPN and MFA. Access to sensitive PI and legal documents is role-restricted.
- Data Retention & Handling: Employees should follow the Data Handling procedures documented in the Security Playbook. Do not store confidential documents on personal devices or public cloud storage without company approval.
- Device Management: The IT/Device Management team will periodically audit devices with company access; employees are expected to comply with remote device security checks.

6) Legal & Tax Compliance (Expanded):
- Local Law Compliance: Employees working in another jurisdiction may trigger tax/benefit obligations. People & Culture will provide guidance, but legal compliance is ultimately the employee's responsibility to confirm for long-term international work.
- Visa & Employment Eligibility: NebulaGears does not manage immigration or visa status for remote work abroad. Employees must ensure their working status is compliant with local laws.

7) PTO, Sick Leave & Time Off:
- Paid Time Off (PTO): Exempt FT employees accrue PTO starting from hire date. Refer to the People & Culture portal for accrual schedules and conversion rules.
- Sick Leave: Employees may use sick leave as per the local policy or law. Submit sick leave requests using the HR portal; for extended medical leaves, coordinate with People & Culture for documentation.
- Holidays: NebulaGears recognizes a set of company-wide holidays and allows local/global teams to decide on additional local holidays on a per-country basis.

8) Compensation & Benefits (High-level):
- Payroll: Employees will be paid through the company payroll system on the standard date for the assigned payroll cycle. Cross-border pay may take longer to set up.
- Benefits: Health insurance, retirement savings, and other benefits are provided according to employee grade and geography. Refer to the benefits guide in the People & Culture portal for details.

9) Performance Reviews & Promotions:
- Review Cadence: Performance reviews should be held at least annually; mid-year calibration is encouraged, especially for high-growth teams.
- Promotion Requirements: Promotions are based on demonstrated impact, role competency, and managerial recommendations according to the Lattice/Performance framework used by the company.

10) Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) & Anti-Harassment:
- Zero Tolerance: Harassment, discrimination, or harmful conduct will not be tolerated. NebulaGears has a formal process for filing complaints, including anonymous reporting to the Ethics line.
- Inclusive Behavior: Employees are expected to create a respectful environment. Training is available on unconscious bias, inclusive leadership, and harassment prevention.

11) Business & Client Interaction Guidelines:
- Professional Conduct: When representing NebulaGears with clients or external partners, maintain professional communication and follow the external communications policy.
- Record Keeping: Client meeting notes and summaries should be stored in the company's secure workspace and referenced in the CRM as required.

12) Travel Policy & Expense Reimbursement:
- Travel Approval: Manager approval is required for client travel, conferences, and on-site work. For higher cost travel, finance approval may be required.
- Reimbursement Process: Submit expenses using the Expense Reimbursement Form with itemized receipts within 30 days for personal reimbursement.

13) Safety, Health & Emergency Guidelines:
- Emergency Contact: Keep emergency contacts up to date in the People & Culture portal. In case of any emergency while remote, follow local emergency services and then notify manager & People & Culture.
- Health Guidelines: NebulaGears supports flexible health policies including remote work when medically advised and will provide accommodation as needed.

- Notice Period: Employees should provide notice as outlined in their employment agreement. Offboarding includes returning company equipment, revoking system access, and conducting an exit interview.
- Knowledge Transfer: The departing employee should document current work, status, and handover notes for the team to continue work smoothly.

15) Intellectual Property & Confidentiality:
- IP Ownership: Work-related intellectual property created during employment belongs to NebulaGears unless explicitly stated; contractors may have different IP terms.
- Confidentiality: Employees must not disclose confidential business information; NDAs and confidentiality clauses as part of employment agreements apply even after termination.

16) Reporting & Escalation Paths:
- Reporting Issues: For HR issues, contact People & Culture. For security incidents, contact Security immediately. For ethics issues, use the anonymous ethics reporting line.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):
- Q: Can I work from a different country for several months at a time?
	A: Short-term travel (< 90 days) is supported in most cases but notify People & Culture. Longer-term cross-border work requires tax & payroll coordination.
- Q: Do I need manager approval to take remote days?
	A: No — the Work From Anywhere program does not require prior approval for remote days, but managers should be informed of extended travel or timezone changes impacting team collaboration.
- Q: Are there specific days I'm required to be in the office?
	A: Not under this version of the handbook, but teams may schedule in-office events for which attendance might be requested for specific reasons.
- Q: What about interns and working from home?
	A: This handbook version does not require interns to be in the office 5 days a week; those details may be outlined in role-specific onboarding guidelines. Teams should confirm expectations with People & Culture.
